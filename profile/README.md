## A memtorship platform

for mentor and mentee connection

The Kano model is a useful tool for categorizing customer preferences into five categories: Attractive, One-Dimensional, Must-Be, Indifferent, and Reverse. This model is often used in product development and customer satisfaction surveys. Here are some potential features for a mentoring platform categorized according to the Kano model:

Must-Be Features: These are basic expectations. If they're not met, users will be dissatisfied.

Secure and private communication: All conversations between mentor and mentee should be confidential and secure.
Basic Search Functionality: Users need to be able to find and connect with potential mentors/mentees.
Profile Management: Both mentors and mentees should be able to create and manage profiles, including information about their experience, skills, etc.
Scheduling system: A system to schedule and manage meetings or sessions.
Responsive User Interface: The platform should be user-friendly and intuitive.
One-Dimensional Features: These features have a linear relationship with customer satisfaction—the better they are, the more satisfaction they bring.

Advanced Matching Algorithm: A system that matches mentors and mentees based on their skills, interests, goals, etc.
Quality of Content: Resources for learning and development like articles, videos, courses, etc.
Mobile Accessibility: A mobile app or a mobile-optimized website.
Real-time Communication Tools: Messaging, voice calls, video calls, etc.
Attractive Features: These are features that users might not expect, but which would increase satisfaction.

AI-Powered Recommendations: AI-driven suggestions for resources, sessions, and mentor-mentee matches.
Gamification: Points, badges, leaderboards, etc., to encourage engagement.
Community Features: Forums or groups where users can interact and learn from each other.
Virtual Reality Sessions: VR sessions for immersive learning experiences.
Indifferent Features: These are features that users don't care about—they neither increase nor decrease satisfaction.

Multiple Language Support: While it might be essential for a global platform, for a more local or niche platform, users might not care about this feature.
Background Themes: Various cosmetic changes to the platform may not matter much to users focused on the mentoring experience.
Reverse Features: These are features that could lead to dissatisfaction if implemented, as different users might have different preferences.

Automatic Posting to Social Media: Some users may not want their usage of the platform to be publicized.
Mandatory Video Calls: Not everyone is comfortable with video communication; forcing this might dissatisfy some users.
Remember, the categorization of features in the Kano model can change based on the target users' preferences and needs. It's essential to gather and analyze user feedback regularly to keep improving the platform.
